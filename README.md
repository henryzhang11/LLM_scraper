# Scraper & Quantized Model Repository

Welcome to the **Scraper & Quantized Model** repository! This project integrates a Python-based web scraping automation tool (`scraper.py`) with a **quantized language model** (`quantized_model.py`) for efficient script generation and evaluation.

## Features

- **Automated Script Generation & Execution** 
  The `Scraper` class iteratively generates and refines Python scripts using a language model.
  
- **Quantized Language Model** 
  Uses `Llama` with a pre-trained **Gemma-2-9B-IT** model to generate scripts and provide critiques.

- **Error Handling & Iterative Refinement** 
  Scripts are evaluated for correctness and revised until they meet the job description.

## Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment  
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Make sure `llama-cpp-python` is installed for the quantized model.)*

## Usage

### Running the Scraper
```python
from scraper import Scraper
from quantized_model import QuantizedModel

# Initialize the model
model = QuantizedModel()

# Define a job description
job_description = "Extract all hyperlinks from a given webpage."

# Generate a script dynamically
script = Scraper.generate(model.language_model, job_description)

# Output the final script
print("Generated Script:\n", script)
```

### Using the Quantized Model Directly
```python
from quantized_model import QuantizedModel

# Load the model
model = QuantizedModel(logprobs=True)

# Generate text from a prompt
response = model.language_model("Write a Python script to scrape titles from a webpage.")
print(response)
```
